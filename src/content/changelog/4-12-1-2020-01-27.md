version: 4.13.0
changelog:
  - API
---
### Changed
- Updated [OAuth section](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/#o-auth) with detailed private and public workflows.

- Updated `Create Kubernetes Cluster` ([POST /lke/clusters](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/lke-clusters/#post)) endpoint to include multiple node pools in the CLI code example.

    - Argument order is imperative. The arguments must be in sequential order `--node_pools.type [type]` followed by `--node_pools.count [count]` for each node pool.

    - You may add one or more node pool to each cluster.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug with migrations and host information. If the migration is a disk, the `from_host` is the disk, if it's a clone, the `from_host` is the Linode. Users can see migration job information in the event endpoints:
  - `List Events` ([GET /account/events](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/))
  - `View Event` ([GET /account/events/{eventId}](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/))

- `+and`, `+or`, and `+order_by` filters for tags are now working.

- Longview will now retain more than 12 hours of statistics for users with the Pro plan.

- The `List Networking Information` ([GET /linode/instances/{linodeId}/ips](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-instances/)) endpoint has been updated to only output IPv6 addresses for the specified Linode instead of all the IPv6 addresses for the customer.
