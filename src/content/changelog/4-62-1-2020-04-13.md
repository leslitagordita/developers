### Fixed

- A bug was causing LKE nodes in the process of being deleted to still appear as part of an LKE node pool. This bug has been fixed.
	- You can view an LKE clusterâ€™s node pools with the View Node Pool endpoint ([GET /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools/{poolId}](/api/v4/lke-clusters-cluster-id-pools-pool-id)).
