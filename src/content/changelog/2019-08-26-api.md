### Added

- Added the Update Managed Credential Username and Password ([POST /managed/credentials/{credentialId}/update](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/managed-credentials-credential-id-update/#post)) endpoint.

### Changed

- The maximum credit card payment that can be made with the Make Payment ([POST /account/payments](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)) endpoint is \$50,000. This value has not changed, but previously this endpoint would return an HTTP 500 error for payments over this amount. If a payment is attempted with this endpoint that exceeds this limit, an HTTP 400 error with a descriptive error message will now be returned.

- The number of concurrent clone operations for any given Linode is now limited to five clones. If a call to the Clone Linode ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/clone](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id-clone/#post)) endpoint would result in a sixth concurrent clone of a Linode, then the endpoint will return an HTTP 400 error with a descriptive error message.

### Fixed

- Previously, the _access_ boolean of the _ssh_ property of a Linode's Managed Settings would display _true_ whenever Managed SSH access was disabled for the Linode, and _false_ when it was enabled, contrary to the naming of the property. This property is returned by the List Managed Linode Settings ([GET /managed/linode-settings](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/managed-linode-settings)) and View Linode's Managed Settings ([GET /managed/linode-settings/{linodeId}](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/managed-linode-settings-linode-id)) endpoints. This property will now correctly display _true_ when Managed SSH access is enabled and _false_ when Managed SSH access is disabled.

  Similarly, setting this property to _true_ via the Update Linode's Managed Settings ([PUT /managed/linode-settings/{linodeId}](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/managed-linode-settings-linode-id/#put)) endpoint would result in Managed SSH access for the Linode being disabled, and setting it to _false_ would result in Managed SSH access being enabled. This behavior is now reversed to align with the naming of the property.
