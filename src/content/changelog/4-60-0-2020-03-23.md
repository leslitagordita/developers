### Added

- The field `authentication_type` has been added to View Profile ([GET /profile](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/profile/)) and Update Profile ([PUT /profile](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/profile/)). `authentication_type` returns your account's Cloud Manager authentication type. Currently, a user's password (in conjunction with their username) is the only available authentication type.

- The `name` field for Create Domain Record ([POST /domains/{domainId}/records](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/domains/)) and Update Domain Record ([PUT /domains/{domainId}/records/{recordId}](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/domains/)) now accepts wildcards for Domain Records of type `TXT`.

- Logic was added to the [Account](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/) collection to generate an Account Notification ([GET /account/notifications](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)) when your account's associated email address bounces ([GET /v4/account ](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)) and when an account user's email address bounces ([GET /account/users/{username}](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)).

- The View Volume ([GET /volumes/{volumeId}](/api/v4/volumes-volume-id)) and List Volumes ([GET /volumes](/api/v4/volumes)) endpoints now have a `linode_label` field. If a Volume is attached to a specific Linode, the label of that Linode will be returned by the `linode_label` field.

### Fixed

- Corrected the field for unit price in the List Invoice Items ([GET /account/invoices/{invoiceId}/items](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)) endpoint. Previously, this field was listed as `unitprice` with type `number`. It is now correctly listed as `unit_price` with type `string`.

- When a Linode that was deployed from a [StackScript](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/stackscripts/) is deleted, that StackScript's `deployments_active` value should decrease. This property's value was incorrectly reporting the number of active deployments for a StackScript. While this bug was addressed in a previous API release, additional work was completed to improve the previous fix.

- Changes were made to improve the performance of the List Networking Information ([GET /linode/instances/{linodeId}/ips](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-instances/)) endpoint.
