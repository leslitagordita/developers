    - *token_create* - This event will be issued when making requests to the *Create Personal Access Token* endpoint ([POST /profile/tokens](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/profile-tokens/#post)).

    - *token_delete* - This event will be issued when making requests to the *Revoke Personal Access Token* endpoint ([DELETE /profile/tokens/:token_id](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/profile-tokens-token-id/#delete)).

    - *token_update* - This event will be issued when making requests to the *Update Personal Access Token* endpoint ([PUT /profile/tokens/:token_id](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/profile-tokens-token-id/#put)).

    - *oauth_client_create* - This event will be issued when making requests to the *Create OAuth Client* endpoint ([POST /account/oauth-clients](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)).

    - *oauth_client_delete* - This event will be issued when making requests to the *Delete OAuth Client* endpoint ([DELETE /account/oauth-clients/:client_id](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)).

    - *oauth_client_secret_reset* - This event will be issued when making requests to the *Reset OAuth Client Secret* endpoint ([POST /account/oauth-clients/:client_id/reset_secret](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)).

    - *oauth_client_update* - This event will be issued when making requests to the *Update OAuth Client* endpoint ([PUT /account/oauth-clients/:client_id](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)).

- Added Tag event actions to the *List Events* endpoint ([GET /account/events](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)) and *View Event* endpoint ([GET /account/events/:event_id](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)).

    - *tag_delete* - This event will be issued when making requests to the *Delete a Tag* endpoint ([DELETE /tags/:label](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/tags-label/#delete)).

### Fixed

- The *Execute Staged/Approved PayPal Payment* ([POST /account/payments/paypal/execute](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)) endpoint will return a more helpful error message whenever PayPal's services are temporarily unavailable.

- The entity field for an *ipaddress_update* event is now populated; it was previously null. Events are returned by the *List Events* ([GET /account/events](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)) and *View Event* ([GET /account/events/:event_id](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)) endpoints.

- The entity field for an *account_update* event is now populated; it was previously null. Events are returned by the *List Events* ([GET /account/events](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)) and *View Event* ([GET /account/events/:event_id](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)) endpoints.

- Calling the *Update Profile* endpoint ([PUT /profile](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/profile/#put)) without specifying an email in your request could previously trigger a notification email. This notification's message stated that your email address had been updated, even though it was not changed. This will no longer occur.

- Previously, if the *Create Disk* ([POST /linode/instances/:linode_id/disks](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-instances/)) or *Create Linode* ([POST /linode/instances](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-instances/)) endpoints were called with a custom image and with a list for the *authorized_users* field, then those authorized users' keys were not configured for the root user of the new disk or Linode. Those keys will now be properly configured on the provisioned disk.
