### Added

- Added the _active_promotions_ property to Accounts, as returned by the View Account ([GET /account](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/))) endpoint. This property lists all active promotions on your account.

  Promotions generally offer a set amount of credit that can be used toward your Linode services, and the promotion expires after a specified date. Simply put, a monthly cap on the promotional offer is set. In other words, a promotion offers a certain amount of credit every month, until either the expiration date is passed, or until the total promotional credit is used, whichever comes first.

- Added _promotion_ to the types of Notifications that can be returned by the List Notifications ([GET /account/notifications](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)) endpoint.
