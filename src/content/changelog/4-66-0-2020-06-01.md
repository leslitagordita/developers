### Changed

- In an effort to fight spam, Linode restricts outbound connections on ports 25, 465, and 587 on all Linodes for new accounts created after November 5th, 2019. This is not a new change; however, this note now appears on the Create Linode ([POST /linode/instances](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-instances/)) endpoint.

- The upper limit for `page_size` can now be set to `500`; the default remains `100`. Refer to the [Pagination](/api/v4/#pagination) section of the Linode API for details on advanced query options.

- A Linode's CPU alert value defaults to 90% multiplied by its number of cores. This is not a new change; however, a note has been added to the [Linode Instances](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-instances/) group of endpoints.
