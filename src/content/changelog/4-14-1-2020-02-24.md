### Fixed

- Previously, when restoring from a backup ([POST
/linode/instances/{linodeId}/backups/{backupId}/restore](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-instances/)) to a Linode that was smaller than the Linode that the backup was created for, disk space could be overallocated. A 400 error message was added to inform the user if they are attempting to restore a backup to a Linode that does not have enough unallocated space available, and overallocation caused by this bug is no longer possible.
